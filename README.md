UPDATE
======
According to this [Issue](https://github.com/cloudfuji/kandan/issues/32) Cloudfuji has disbanded.

In speaking with [@kevzettler](https://github.com/kevzettler) and [@sgrove](https://github.com/sgrove) both [@jrgifford](https://github.com/jrgifford) and I ([@fusion94](https://github.com/fusion94)) are going to attempt to maintain it.

As such all new development will be happening in this repository and we will be utilizing this [Issue tracker](https://github.com/kandanapp/kandan/issues) moving forward.
