## Cloud Foundry
You'll need a [Cloud Foundry account](https://my.cloudfoundry.com/signup) and the [vmc gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/vmc) installed. Do you `vmc target <cloud foundry host>` and `vmc login`, and then this will get you up and running:

    git clone https://github.com/kandanapp/kandan.git
    cd kandan
    bundle install
    bundle exec rake assets:precompile
    vmc push my-company-chat --path . --instances 1 --mem 256M --runtime ruby19
    
You'll answer a few questions:

    Application Deployed URL [my-company-chat.cloudfoundry.com]: 
    Detected a Rails Application, is this correct? [Yn]: 
    Creating Application: OK
    Would you like to bind any services to 'my-company-chat'? [yN]: y
    Would you like to use an existing provisioned service? [yN]: n
    The following system services are available
    1: mongodb
    2: mysql
    3: postgresql
    4: rabbitmq
    5: redis
    Please select one you wish to provision: 3
    Specify the name of the service [postgresql-246de]: 
    Creating Service: OK
    Binding Service [postgresql-246de]: OK
    Uploading Application:
    Checking for available resources: OK
    Processing resources: OK
    Packing application: OK
    Uploading (1M): OK   
    Push Status: OK
    Staging Application: OK
    Starting Application: OK
    
And Kandan should be available on your Cloud Foundry backend now!

## Heroku
You'll need to have the [heroku gem](https://github.com/heroku/heroku) installed and to have an existing heroku account. Assuming that, this should work reliably on Heroku:

    git clone https://github.com/kandanapp/kandan.git
    cd kandan
    heroku create --stack cedar
    git push heroku master
    heroku run rake db:migrate kandan:bootstrap && heroku open
    echo "Done, go forth and chat!"
    # Not too bad
    
### Integrate Kandan on Heroku with your Amazon S3_BUCKET ( [Heroku article on AWS S3 to store static assets and file uploads](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3) ). Run the following line, replacing the the global variable values with your own:

	heroku config:add S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxx S3_BUCKET=bucket_name

If successful you should get a response similar to:

	Setting config vars and restarting myapp... done, v12
	S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: xxx
	S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: xxxx
	S3_BUCKET: bucket_name

Your app should be up and running now. The admin email by default is `admin@kandan.me` with password `kandanadmin`, or you can sign up as another user.

## Heroic server install
If you're looking to install Kandan on a private server, or to develop locally for lemonodor fame, then here is the path you must follow, young hero:

    For development-mode
    
    `sudo apt-get install nodejs` # (execjs needs an execution environment)
    `gem install execjs` # (Could possibly be added to the gemfile in the assets group)

    Get the new gems:

    `bundle install`

    Use the default database.yml to get started - you'll need to edit config/database.yml for *production* - you'll need to add something like this:

    production:
      adapter: postgresql
      host: localhost
      database: kandan_development
      pool: 5
      timeout: 5000
 
    Now, bootstrap the install
    `bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate kandan:bootstrap`
    `bundle exec thin start`
