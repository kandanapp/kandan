	<h3>Description</h3>
	
	<p>Kandan is an Open Source alternative to HipChat.</p>
	
	<p>What is Kandan? Kandan is a private chat service for your company or team. You can invite colleagues to share ideas and files in a persistent group chat room or rooms.</p>

	<p>Unlike HipChat or other alternatives, Kandan is completely Open Source and can be hosted internally or externally by your organization or by a third party. </p>

	<h3>Background</h3>

	<p>Kandan was originally developed by <a href="http://cloudfuji.com/">Cloudfuji</a> and they started development on it back on March 6th of 2012. Development went pretty fast and furious until about June 4th of 2012. After that there wasn’t another commit to the repository until some pull requests came in during the month of January of 2013.</p>

	<p>In February of 2013 control of the project was transfered to the current development team.</p>

	</ul>

	<p>Since Kandan is a fully open-source app, we would appreciate if you dive in and start adding features, fixing bugs (what bugs?), and cleaning up the code.</p>

	<p>But before you jump right in there there are a few caveats.</p>

	<p>If you’re going to contribute code then you’re going to have to sign our <a href="http://www.clahub.com/agreements/kandanapp/kandan">Contributor License Agreement</a> (hereafter referred to as CLA) which is modeled after the one that <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> uses.</p>

	<p>A CLA is a legal document in which you state you are entitled to contribute the code/documentation/translation to the project you’re contributing to and are willing to have it used in distributions and derivative works. This means that should there be any kind of legal issue in the future as to the origins and ownership of any particular piece of code, then that project has the necessary forms on file from the contributor(s) saying they were permitted to make this contribution.</p>

	<p>The CLA also ensures that once you have provided a contribution, you cannot try to withdraw permission for its use at a later date. People and companies can therefore use that software, confident that they will not be asked to stop using pieces of the code at a later date.</p>

	<p>Please also take the time to read these two wiki pages in regards to contributing.</p>
