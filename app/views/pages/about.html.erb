	<h3>Version 1.0</h3>

	<h3>Description</h3>
	
	<p>Kandan is an Open Source alternative to HipChat.</p>
	
	<p>What is Kandan? Kandan is a private chat service for your company or team. You can invite colleagues to share ideas and files in a persistent group chat room or rooms.</p>

	<p>Unlike HipChat or other alternatives, Kandan is completely Open Source and can be hosted internally or externally by your organization or by a third party.</p>

	<h3>Background</h3>

	<p>Kandan was originally developed by <a href="http://cloudfuji.com/">Cloudfuji</a> and they started development on it back on March 6th of 2012. Development went pretty fast and furious until about June 4th of 2012. After that there wasnâ€™t another commit to the repository until some pull requests came in during the month of January of 2013.</p>

	<p>In talking with the team at Cloudfuji both <a href="http://jamesrgifford.com/">James Gifford</a> and <a href="http://fusion94.org">Tony Guntharp</a> agreed to take over maintenance of the project.</p>

	<h3>Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Easy deploy to CloudFoundry, Heroku, dotCloud, etc.</li>
			<li>Unlimited channels</li>
			<li>Embed formats for images and youtube videos with requests for others (twitter, facebook, g+, etc.)</li>
			<li>/me command</li>
			<li>Highly extensible plugin format</li>
		</ul>
